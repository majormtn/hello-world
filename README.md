# hello-world

Hi all!

My name is Veronica and I've never used github before. I mean, I've searched through the site, researching issues that were similar to the ones I was facing, but I've never used it to display my work. Also, I'm sure I have an old account floating around from 2012. 

I'm hoping to use this platform to both connect with other coders as well as to learn from others about new technologies. 

On a random note: My identicon looks like Princess Bubblegum. Coincidence?
