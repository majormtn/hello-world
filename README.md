# hello-world

Hi all!

My name is Veronica and I've never used github before. I mean, I've searched through the site when I needed help on projects. I'm sure I also have an old account floating around somewhere from 2012. 

I'm hoping to use this platform to both connect with other coders as well as to learn from others about new technologies. 

On a random note: My identicon looks like Princess Bubblegum. Coincidence?
